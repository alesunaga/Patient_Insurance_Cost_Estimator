# Patient_Insurance_Cost_Estimator
This project defines a `Patient` class in Python to represent patient medical information and estimate their insurance costs based on a simplified formula. It's a basic example demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts and can be used as a starting point for more complex healthcare-related applications.
